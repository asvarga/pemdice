Easy versions:
- Get just first skeleton
- No parens
  - Forces strictly increasing precedence 

Ideas:
- Maybe 
  - outer loop first splits into 3 parts
    - Right of =
    - Left of = inside parens
    - Left of = outside parens
  - Then each part has strictly increasing precedence
- Can also group ops based on arity to allow efficient splitting
- Can split number concatenation into its own loops
  - NOT including unary negation, because it can negate an expression (-4^2 = -16, not 16)
- Bring jux handling to outer loop


- A lot of this depends on assumptions like
  - exactly 1 set of parentheses
  - other limits on dice
